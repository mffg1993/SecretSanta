# SecretSanta

Motivated by the particular needs of our group of friends. I developed a self-contained application to generate a list of people for a gift exchange. 

Here, I applied some constrains that may spice up the game: 

- There is only a single loop. Therefore, the list is a single dearregement of the orignal entry.
- The emails are sent from a personal email, so your data is not somewhere in the internet
- Partners are excluded from each other in the list. No one gets a easy buy in this version.

I hope you enjoy your holidays and thanks for using this code that I put together after a couple of hours.
